# 1. Use the right tools for webmaster

###### Each search engine has a set of free tools that business owners can use to give their company visibility in search results. Start using Google's webmaster tools to get tips on how your site is appearing in Google's search results (now you can add webmaster to your list of responsibilities - congratulations!). You will receive information about how often Google is crawling your site, how many pages are cataloged and other useful notifications, such as broken links or duplicate content. Please note: for an even deeper understanding of your SEO performance you can link your Google Webmaster account with your Google Analytics account.

# 2. Make your business easy to find
###### Think like you are one of your customers and ask yourself what phrases you would use to search for the products or services offered by your company. Most people type two or three simple words or a short phrase into the search box. These generic phrases are the most popular and, as a result, will generate the highest search volume. Something like "cheap flights", for example, to an airline or travel agency. However, the most popular phrases are also the most competitive. Therefore, it will be very difficult to be able to appear on the first page of the survey with just them. It is necessary to find a balance between the generic and the specific, which may be less competitive, but still present a strong volume of research, such as "cheap flights to Miami" or "flights from Boston to Miami". When choosing 10 keywords to portray the focus of your business, try to strike the perfect balance between the extremely popular terms with the most specific ones. Also remember to avoid jargon, acronyms or abbreviations specific to the industry, words used in your daily life. You and your team may know what they mean, but the average consumer will not.

# 3. Enter the title (right) and description
###### Now that the 10 key words / terms are defined, it's time to choose what is perhaps the most important for an SEO content page: the title and description. After all, they are the ones who will show what your business is on the results page of a search engine. The page title, which is referred to as the title tag in the website code, must include an important keyword that you want to increase in the ranking and that represents the content of the page. The golden rule is to keep the page title to a maximum of 55 characters. The description (meta description in the website code) should be a short sentence that provides more details about the business and information about what is on the page. A well-done description helps the potential customer understand exactly what they will see after clicking on the link. The point is to manage user expectations and experience correctly. Make your description with a maximum of 150 characters. Most content management and website creation tools make it easy to update titles and description without having to edit the code.

# 4. Keep your original content, updated and simple
###### Regardless of whether you manage a website with three pages or one with thousands of pages of content, the fundamental principles of producing information for posting online remain the same. All important content must be original, found only on your website and formatted as plain text. This helps to establish your website as an authority on a given subject by search engines and increases the chance that your pages will have your keywords high in the ranking of search engines. Any highlighted text within an image will not be visible to a search engine crawler and therefore will not be assigned to your website.

# 5. Remember that images are also content
###### It is easy to focus exclusively on the written content of a website and to forgo the optimization of visual content. Keep in mind that original images and photographs are also valuable content, which can be powerful sources of traffic and new consumers. They are a great way to visually show the difference of your products and services to your audience. In order for search engines to understand the content of the images and correctly catalog them, add text to describe each photo. Better than that: make sure you make life easier for bloggers and website owners by sharing your photos and images on their own websites or through popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.
