# What is Google Analytics?
Google Analytics is the most used website and application monitoring and analysis tool in the world. Some of its advantages are: ease of configuration, integration with other Google services, such as Ads and Search Console, and a very complete free version. With the tool installed correctly, it is possible to monitor the profile of those who access your website, the most accessed pages, conversions, devices, cities and many other data. 

# 3 reasons to use Google Analytics
There are certainly a thousand and one questions you ask yourself every day about your business or your blog. Many of them can be easily answered by simply opening Google Analytics.
Data about your page's traffic, your visitors' location, source channels and real-time information about what is happening on your site are a fraction of what can be seen in the tool.
Monitoring the behavior of your target audience is important on several levels, but here are some relevant examples for any business:

**1. Understand the best time for your actions**
Know the days of the month, the week or even the hours that your visitors most engage with the site.
With these data in hand, in addition to being able to schedule actions, it is also possible to know what not to do at peak times, such as a website update that will reach a large part of its users.

**2. Discover causes for abandoning your site**
Analyze the bounce rate. That is, how many of your visitors leave your site without even interacting with it.
If you sell a service and your website is not generating sales, you already know that something is wrong, but by analyzing this data, it is easier to understand if the problem is on the page or on the product itself.

**3. Understand which devices your visitors use**
Today it is essential that your pages are optimized for mobile devices. This is even one of the issues that can harm you in the search results, if it does not comply with Google guidelines.
But in addition, it is possible that you need to invest more in mobile over time, or even that, for your business, it makes more sense to develop applications or actions for mobile and not more for desktop.
Analyzing your traffic through Analytics it is possible to know which device has been most used by your visitors to access your website.


# How to use Google Analytics: the basic settings

First, you will need a Google account. Give preference to one that only you have access to and that is for professional use, since you should use it as long as the site exists.
Then, just go to the Google Analytics homepage and click on create an account.
The system itself will indicate the next steps. After clicking on the “Sign up” button and filling in the requested data, you will receive a tracking code.
The code must be inserted on all pages of your website. Usually in html pages the code is added before the closing </head> tag.
The insertion site may vary. If your site was made in WordPress, for example, you can look for an option to put the code in the header, or even install a plugin to facilitate the process.
Ready! Now it is necessary to wait 24 hours for your data to start being collected.
If you want other people to use Analytics, no problem: you can grant that access later. To give access to other users, go to "Administrator", select the desired account and click "User management".
In "Add permissions for" enter the email of the Google user you want to add and choose the permission to be granted. Click "add".
It is worth remembering that the tool brings countless possibilities and, the better configured it is, the more structured data it will be able to collect.
So, a great idea is to go deeper into both the configuration and the analysis and reports that it is capable of generating.
Google itself provides a channel on YouTube and a specific page for learning with tips and courses on the service offered by them.

# Tips for getting more out of Google Analytics
**1 - Secondary dimensions**
The first essential tip is the secondary dimensions. It is relatively simple and already delivers a lot of value to anyone who is analyzing. Although simple, most people do not know how to use it properly or even know that this feature exists.
**Primary dimensions**
Before talking about the secondary, let's first talk about the primary. This is the part that most people are most familiar with. Roughly speaking, it is the main parameter you want to analyze, such as “pages”, “origin” and “campaign”. When selecting a primary dimension (such as “pages”), I will see the performance in numbers of all my pages, such as the number of visitors, average time, bounce rate, etc.
