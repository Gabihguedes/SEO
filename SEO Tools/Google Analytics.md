# What is Google Analytics?
Google Analytics is the most used website and application monitoring and analysis tool in the world. Some of its advantages are: ease of configuration, integration with other Google services, such as Ads and Search Console, and a very complete free version. With the tool installed correctly, it is possible to monitor the profile of those who access your website, the most accessed pages, conversions, devices, cities and many other data. 

# 3 reasons to use Google Analytics
There are certainly a thousand and one questions you ask yourself every day about your business or your blog. Many of them can be easily answered by simply opening Google Analytics.
Data about your page's traffic, your visitors' location, source channels and real-time information about what is happening on your site are a fraction of what can be seen in the tool.
Monitoring the behavior of your target audience is important on several levels, but here are some relevant examples for any business:

**1. Understand the best time for your actions**
Know the days of the month, the week or even the hours that your visitors most engage with the site.
With these data in hand, in addition to being able to schedule actions, it is also possible to know what not to do at peak times, such as a website update that will reach a large part of its users.

**2. Discover causes for abandoning your site**
Analyze the bounce rate. That is, how many of your visitors leave your site without even interacting with it.
If you sell a service and your website is not generating sales, you already know that something is wrong, but by analyzing this data, it is easier to understand if the problem is on the page or on the product itself.

**3. Understand which devices your visitors use**
Today it is essential that your pages are optimized for mobile devices. This is even one of the issues that can harm you in the search results, if it does not comply with Google guidelines.
But in addition, it is possible that you need to invest more in mobile over time, or even that, for your business, it makes more sense to develop applications or actions for mobile and not more for desktop.
Analyzing your traffic through Analytics it is possible to know which device has been most used by your visitors to access your website.


# How to use Google Analytics: the basic settings

First, you will need a Google account. Give preference to one that only you have access to and that is for professional use, since you should use it as long as the site exists.
Then, just go to the Google Analytics homepage and click on create an account.
The system itself will indicate the next steps. After clicking on the “Sign up” button and filling in the requested data, you will receive a tracking code.
The code must be inserted on all pages of your website. Usually in html pages the code is added before the closing </head> tag.
The insertion site may vary. If your site was made in WordPress, for example, you can look for an option to put the code in the header, or even install a plugin to facilitate the process.
Ready! Now it is necessary to wait 24 hours for your data to start being collected.
If you want other people to use Analytics, no problem: you can grant that access later. To give access to other users, go to "Administrator", select the desired account and click "User management".
In "Add permissions for" enter the email of the Google user you want to add and choose the permission to be granted. Click "add".
It is worth remembering that the tool brings countless possibilities and, the better configured it is, the more structured data it will be able to collect.
So, a great idea is to go deeper into both the configuration and the analysis and reports that it is capable of generating.
Google itself provides a channel on YouTube and a specific page for learning with tips and courses on the service offered by them.

# Tips for getting more out of Google Analytics
## Secondary dimensions
The first essential tip is the secondary dimensions. It is relatively simple and already delivers a lot of value to anyone who is analyzing. Although simple, most people do not know how to use it properly or even know that this feature exists.

## Primary dimensions
Before talking about the secondary, let's first talk about the primary. This is the part that most people are most familiar with. Roughly speaking, it is the main parameter you want to analyze, such as “pages”, “origin” and “campaign”. When selecting a primary dimension (such as “pages”), I will see the performance in numbers of all my pages, such as the number of visitors, average time, bounce rate, etc.

## Secondary dimensions
The secondary dimensions allow to deepen the analysis in the primary dimensions. When selecting a particular primary property (for example the ‘/ blog’ page), it is possible to use the secondary dimensions, which open up several possibilities for analysis.
For example:
Primary dimension: Page -> shows a list of pages and performance per page
Clicking on the ‘/ blog’ page and selecting the secondary dimension “type of traffic” -> shows the distribution of visits to the blog according to the type of traffic source (organic, direct, referral, social, etc.).

## Track campaigns
One of the great advantages of Digital Marketing is the possibility of measuring the return on investment of marketing actions. To help with this, it is very common to separate these actions by campaigns. And it is this tracking of actions and campaigns that Google Analytics can help measure.
Imagine that you are running a specific Christmas campaign. In this campaign, you send some Email Marketing, buy ads on Ads and Facebook Ads, buy banner space on some website and make a series of guest posts on blogs. The big goal with all these actions is to bring traffic and convert these visitors into Leads.
Through the trackable URLs that we explain in the post What is UTM and how to create parameters for your URLs with a UTM Generator (URL Builder), it is possible to group all these specific actions in a campaign and see how many visits and conversions it has generated.

## Create dashboard
We can translate Dashboards as a control panel, that is, a compilation of the main information and metrics of your business. They are essential for those who work with quantitative data, making it easier to follow the main metrics and have a view of the whole.
In GA we find a multitude of metrics, but some are much more strategic for your business than others. For this reason, Google allows you to choose for yourself what will be the first information you will see when you sign in to your account.

Building the Dashboard in GA basically boils down to adding widgets, which are interfaces created by Google itself for tracking numbers. You just need to know what to follow and assemble the widgets according to your need.
GA also provides the ability to import Dashboards built by others, as long as they have been made publicly available.
Some possible examples are new user schedules, session geomaps and bar graphs for the bounce rate of the page.
An alternative solution for those seeking practicality and even deeper analysis is the use of specialized software, such as Marketing BI, an integral part of RD Station Marketing. In it you can find all the main metrics related to your business, acquisition channels and campaigns.
