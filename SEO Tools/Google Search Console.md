# What is Google Search Console
Google Search Console is a tool made available by Google free of charge. Until 2015, it was called Webmaster Tools. In early 2018, it was redesigned and relaunched in Beta, until September, when the new version was released, on December 13, Google announced the migration of the following services to a new version: AMP, Index Status, Links, Manual Actions , Mobile Usability, Rich Cards, and Search Analytics, in addition, Google plans to migrate even more functionality from the old version to the new one.
Some tools from the old Google Search Console are not available in the new one, but are still accessible from the previous interface. That is why (and out of habit), most users still use the old version.
Just from all the changes, its raison d'Ãªtre has always been the same: with its reports and features, it allows you to analyze your website traffic, checking your search performance.
If performance is poor, it offers ways to make your pages stand out in searches. In addition, Google's webmaster tool shows the way to fix problems that cause poor performance.
It is widely used by SEO experts, and can be accessed at this link. In this post, we will give more emphasis to the features of the old version, because, as we said earlier, it is still what most professionals are using.

## How Google Search Console works
The following is a short summary of each of the Google Search Console features:

* Search Appearance: How Google is reading each part of the pages - titles, descriptions, images etc;
* Search Traffic: What people are looking for on Google that causes them to click (or not) on your site;
* Google Index: How is Google's performance in indexing the pages of your site and identifying the keywords that appear most;
* Security issues: Notifications of security issues detected on your site;
* Other additional resources: Testing tools, business wizards and more.

## Search Appearance
In this Search Aspects topic, you can analyze the optimizations you can make to improve the appearance of your website when it appears in Google's search results:
Structured Data
It is a report that serves to identify the data that is structured on your site, and that Google can identify on your page to understand and add rich snippets (search results with information optimized to make them attractive).
Understand structured data as a set of information with a standard structure, for example, sequence of articles containing author, date, title; or else, a list of restaurants with address information, user ratings, prices, etc.
This report is important for analyzing data and markup errors found on the page.
There are two types of structured data errors:

* **Missing field:** For example: did not indicate the author, or title of the article;
* **Absent better or worse evaluation:** For example: a product is classified on a 5-point scale, but the minimum and maximum value parameters - bestRating (5) or worstRating (1) have not been marked.

## Search Traffic
This report has important features for identifying detailed traffic information for your site:

**Search Analitycs**
In this report, you can identify organic traffic to your site and gain insights into possible optimizations. The report presents:

* **The keywords on which your site appeared in the search results:** If you have a problem with (not provided) to analyze the keywords that led users to your site in Analytics, here is the solution. Pay attention to the words that bring the most traffic, and invest in them;
* **The pages of your website that have been referenced:** Analyze whether the pages you consider important are really paying off;
* **Countries that accessed:** If applicable, optimize pages for other languages that also have traffic to your domain;
* **If it was a mobile or desktop device:** If you have a lot of access on mobile, make sure that your pages are responsive;
* **Whether the search was for the web or specifically for images:** This is a way to check if the images are being indexed. If you want to know how to optimize the search for your images, see this article with Google optimization guidelines.
* **Analysis by date:** Extract analysis and comparison of data by a specific date.
And in all the information you can know how many clicks and impressions (user view in search results), which CTR (how many views had and which had clicks) and what the average position obtained.

* **Clicks:** Number of clicks that took users to your site.
* **Impressions:** How many views the link to your site had in Google search results, even if it was not displayed by scrolling.
* **CTR (click-through-rate):** Click count divided by impression count. A high CTR means that the appearance of your site in search results is assertive, that is, whoever saw it was interested and clicked. If there are no impressions, the CTR will be displayed as a dash (-), as it would be divided by zero.
* **Position:** the average position of your site's main result in search results. If there are no impressions, the position will be displayed as a dash, as it will not exist.
