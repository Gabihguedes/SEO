Every time a link on your site is referenced by someone on any other page, Linkstant issues an alert in your mailbox informing the page on which your site is cited, as well as which post is being related to that content.

In other words: you will always be notified when you get a backlink.

It is a very useful tool to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of a post.
