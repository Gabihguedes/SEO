There are several sites that propose to carry out an analysis of your blog or website and recommend improvements. Among them, Woorank is a great option. It performs a very thorough analysis, both of the elements of your site and of the external elements and makes some good recommendations. It is a great way to evaluate your blog and compare it with your competitors. I thank Jorge Purgly for suggesting this article.

## Introduction
There are many technical factors that all of us who have a blog or website should be concerned with in order to maintain the quality of our work:

* Use tags to optimize search results;
* Get backlinks to our blog;
* Add tags to images;

One difficulty - especially for those just starting out, is remembering all these details. Woorank is a service that facilitates this work: it has a list with dozens of items that are automatically evaluated. As a result, a report is generated that gives you a grade from 0 (worst result) to 100 (best result), showing which items you should better. So it is a great tool to help you evolve your blog, indicating which are the important points that you may be leaving out. As you can analyze any site in the tool, it is also a great benchmark option, so you can compare your results with your competitor and understand what he does better than you.

## Starting with Woorank
Upon logging into Woorank, you can instantly create a review by simply entering the URL. You can choose between Advanced and Standard Review, with the former providing you with a more detailed report. The amount of Advanced Reviews that you can use is limited, while you can do an unlimited amount of standard reviews. Either way, both options are able to provide you with sufficient amount of data.

Woorank also lists down the reviews that you have already done, along with their score, and options such as starting an Advanced Review, downloading a PDF, and download slides for your report. You also get to see the Woorank score of the website, which is their measurement of website performance, with 100 being the highest. Now that’s been covered, we can start by looking at the reviews.

## Website Review
For the website reviews section, let us take a look in one of the reviews that we have done as a sample. The sample URL here is google.com, which has an 88 score at Woorank, which gives it a solid score indicative of good performance. Let’s click on that and begin viewing the review.

Upon clicking the review, you immediately see the Woorank score, along with the options to refresh your review, download the report, or start an Advanced review. All of the data is displayed in a single page, which is why quick navigation buttons are present to make it easier to get through different sections. Let us look into each detail more closely.

## SEO
The second section of the website review is about the website’s SEO. This will help  you determine how search engine-friendly your website is by looking into key details. The first few segments of the SEO review tackles some of the basic details, such as title tag, meta description, Google preview, headings, and the Keywords Cloud. The Keywords Cloud shows you some of the keywords that are frequently used within the webpage, which helps with your keyword research efforts.

The next segment shows the Keyword Consistency, Alt Attribute, and the Discovered Pages. Keyword Consistency shows you some of the most frequent keywords entered by the users. Alt attributes refer to the alt text that helps search engines crawl on images. Discovered Pages refer to the number of bots that are able to discover your page, which helps increase its presence in search engines.

The next section reviews the links within your website. In-page links lists down all the links present in the website, while Broken Links track down links that need to be optimized. WWW Resolve ensures that your website can be accessed with or without the www. prefix.

The next section is the Robots.txt, XML Sitemap, Sitemaps Validity, and Underscored in the URLs. Robots.txt and XML Sitemap makes sure that the right pages are being indexed for search engines. Sitemaps Validity and Underscored in the URLs are indicators of webpage searchability, and makes it easier for crawlers to access these pages.

The last part of the SEO section is the Blocking Factors, Domain Registration, Blog, and Related Websites. Blocking Factors is a list of reasons that your website can be blocked or penalized by Google. Domain Registration shows the Domain age, and the date in which the domain would expire. The blog section check if a website has a blog section for posting content. Related websites show your competitors, and some statistics such as pages, backlinks, and their Woorank score.
